## Connections
___
- *TBD:* Level 2

### PC Bonds

#### Housemates: Ward

Two characters live in the same home. They share at least some significant space, but each probably has personal space as well. They must work out various issues (who pays for what? who does the dishes?).

- **Benefit:** Shared expenses, as well as combined house “values.”
- **Drawback:** The lack of an additional house.

## Foundation: Itinerant

- **Income:** 40 crystal orbs
- **Initial savings:** 120 crystal orbs

### House
*Level 3*

Average. Lives at Ward's house. Arca borough, Fartown.

### Neighbors

- Halfway house for semi-departed spirits, run by a sweet, matronly, snake-headed woman.
- There is also a petty tyrant of the halfway house (“Marty”) Not actually dead, but insists he’s almost there. Lots to say, no real authority. He’s been here for 10 years.
- There’s a section of the street that has an coordinated routine briefly each morning (Truman Show/Simpsons/90s sitcom opening-style).

### Points of Interest

- Cathedral. Bells peal backwards, echo first, on the half hour.
- 5-minute restaurant: only open for 5 minutes a day, always full, but no one is seen entering or leaving.

### Local Issues/Rumours

- Every map of the neighbourhood has a 3-block, inaccessible location. It changes with each map, always differently wrong.

## Shadow

- **Name:** Astrid Mendez
- **Occupation:** Dancer
- **Skill:** Perfect positioning (a coordination skill; always able to position her body in the best location for what she is doing).
- **Memento:** A pendant given by her first lover

## Soul: The Eye

Often confused with the Watcher, the Eye sees what it sees unintentionally. In Shadow, the saying goes that the eye is the window to the soul, and that applies here. The Eye is more about the thoughts, impressions, and sensations of the soul than what is actually seen. It is the impact on the viewer rather than what is viewed. Rather than being interested in knowledge for its own sake, the Eye values experience and understanding. Introspective, it sees inward as well as out.

**Symbol/Image:** The Eye is often stylized in many forms.

**Gift:** The character vanishes until the sun next sets, having retreating into their own soul. When they reappear, it is wherever they wish.

## Arc: Uncover a Secret

There is knowledge out there that you want.

- (*Active*) **Opening:** Naming the Secret. 1 Acumen reward. You give your goal a name.
- **Step(s):** Research. 1 Acumen reward. You scour libraries and old tomes for clues and information.
- **Step(s):** Investigation. 1 Acumen reward. You talk to people to gain clues and information.
- **Step(s):** Tracking. 1 Acumen reward. You track down the source of the secret information and travel to it.
- **Climax:** Revelation. 2 Acumen reward. You find and attempt to use the secret, whatever that entails. A successful resolution results in 1 Joy. Failure results in 1 Despair.
- **Resolution:** 1 Acumen reward. You contemplate how this secret affects you and the world.

## Ephemera

Ephemera limit: 3

#### Houses Never lived In
*Gold*

- **Level 2 Incantation**

When you cast this prior to going to sleep, you dream of your Shadow self and life. While wandering the alleyways of these dreams, you may choose a single Shadow object that you can hold in one hand, such as a memento, photo, hand tool, and so on, and bring it back to the Actuality with you. When you wake, the object is in your hand. It works as any object brought from Shadow normally would.

#### What Lies Beneath the Leaves is Life
*Green*

- **Level 2 Incantation (+1 die)**

All seeds near you instantly sprout and grow to their full size. All eggs (including insect eggs) near you hatch, and the young immediately grow to adults. After this, the plants and creatures life and grow as they normally would.

#### Juice of Life
*Green*

- **Level 2 Ephemera Object (Clear elixir)**

You drip this on the ground, which causes a vine to grow and sprout pods containing enough food to sustain one person for a day.
