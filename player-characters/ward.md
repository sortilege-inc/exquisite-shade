## Order: Maker, 1st Degree: Shaper

### Signature Object

*Confirm* - Hallowed Cane (25 orbs)

## Forte: Provides a Vessel for Spirits

#### Call Upon Spirit
*Green*

- **Level 1**

I open myself up to whatever spirits might be nearby, allowing one to take control of my body and use it as it wishes for up to one minute. In return, the spirit restores my body, healing 1 Wound and enhancing my next action by +1 die.


## Foundation: Stalwart

- **Income:** 50 crystal orbs
- **Initial savings:** 100 crystal orbs

### House
*Level 3*

Average. Shared with Rhea. Arca borough, Fartown.

### Neighbors

- The oversharer. Insecure to the point of desperation. Oblivious that Ward doesn’t reciprocate.
- Local journal (“Dewey defeats Truman”). Always the opposite of correct, in hindsight. Weather forecasts are great. Classifieds are a nightmare. People get together each morning to try to interpret it.
- The road two blocks over is sentient. It has strong opinions, and greets everyone. People are a little on-edge/overly cautious around it. Friend of Ward’s.

### Points of Interest

- Local amphitheatre, complete with a curtain that opens/closes according to its own logic. People leave it alone when it;s closed, but it almost always has someone speaking from it or performing something on it when it’s open.
Bazaar – bespoke, foreign objects except for one vendor trying to sell local fruit.
- Birding hole (cast balloons to catch birds)

### Local Issues/Rumors

- Should streets vote?
- If you see the heat wave and walk through, you’ll end up somewhere else in Satyrine.

## Connections
___
- **Order of Makers:** Level 1
- **Cathedral of Illuminism:** Level 3
- *TBD:* Level 1

## Bonds

### PC Bonds

#### Housemates: Rhea

Two characters live in the same home. They share at least some significant space, but each probably has personal space as well. They must work out various issues (who pays for what? who does the dishes?).

- **Benefit:** Shared expenses, as well as combined house “values.”
- **Drawback:** The lack of an additional house.

## Shadow

- **Name:** Thomas
- **Occupation:** Medical examiner
- **Skill:** Anatomy
- **Memento:** *Confirm* - Touch case, or my medical license or something.

## Soul: The Doctor

Knowledge—and more important, the application of that knowledge—is the purview of the Doctor. The Doctor has many secrets but is unafraid to reveal them when the time is right.

**Symbol/Image:** A masked androgynous figure, usually in a cloak with a black valise, represents the Doctor.

**Gift:** The character gains +2 on all actions until the sun next sets

## Arc: Assist an Organization
You set out ot accomplish something that will further an organization.

- (*Active*) **Opening:** Responding to the Call. 1 Acumen reward. You work out all the details of what's expected of you, and what rewards (if any) you may get. You also get the specifics of what's required to join and advance.
- **Step:** Sizing up the task. 2 Acumen reward. This requires some action. A reconnaissance mission. An investigation.
- **Step(s):** Undertaking the task. 2 Acumen reward. Because this arc can vary so widely based on the task involved, there might be multiple steps like this one.
- **Climax:** Completing the task. 3 Acumen reward. A successful resolution results in 1 Joy. Failure results in 1 Despair.
- **Resolution:** 1 Acumen reward. Collecting your reward (if any) and conferring with the people in the organization that you spoke to. Perhaps getting access to higher-ranking people in the organization. You can choose to have your connection to the organization increase by 1 level rather than take the Acumen reward.

## Spells

#### Skeletal Key
*Gold*

- **Level 3**

The tip of my finger becomes a key, and I can attempt to pick a lock, enhanced by +1 die. Sealed doors without keyholes or locks have one for the duration of this spell, so that I can "pick" a barred or magically sealed door to open it.

## Secrets

*None*

## Materials & Ingredients

- **Iron**: Level 1 material
- **Glass**: Level 1 material
- **Honey**: Level 1 ingredient

## Ephemera

Ephemera limit: 4

#### Fruiting Bodies
*Green*

- **Level 3 Ephemera Object (+1 die) (Grey potion - poison)**

Mushrooms and fungi sprout and grow all over your body. Even if you pull them or cut them off - which is painful, but doesn't inflict damage - they grow back in a few minutes. (Eating them makes one sick). You look and smell terrible, and suffer a -1 penalty on all interactions.

#### Floatberry
*Green*

- **Level 2 Ephemera Object (Dark blue berry)**
- **Depletion:** 0-2 (check each hour)

You become slightly lighter than air. You float into the air at a rate of about 3 feet (1 m) per round. You have no control over your ascent or descent unless you are able to use a physical aid like a rope. These berries grow wild in remote areas of Silver as well as the Green.

#### You Cannot Die Where There Is No Earth
*Gold*

- **Level 3 Incantation**

The ground opens up beneath you in an area exactly as big around as you are. The hole instantly fills with a colorless, tasteless liquid that beckons you in. Should you choose to enter it, you trigger a major magical flux. If the flux would affect you personally (such as adding vex to your pools or causing you to suffer injuries or other undesirable effects), you may choose to direct it to someone else within long range instead.

#### The Tree Glows With Its Own Light
*Pale*

- **Level 3 Incantation**

You touch an ordinary plant, absorb its life force, and add 2 to your Sorcery. The plant dies.

## Objects of Power

#### The Complaint of the Lost
*Pale*

- **Level 2 - Silver Bracelet**
- **Object Depletion:** 0 (check each use)

This object allows the wearer to conjure a single random nonmagical item that they can hold in one hand. The item summoned is one that was in the midst of being used by its prior owner.
