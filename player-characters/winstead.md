### House
*Level 4*

Large/hidden/unique (*not yet discovered*).

Currently living in an abandoned building in Gatesmithe, Fartown.

### Neighbors

- Whimsical bicycle repair shop; importantly, they only repair bicycles, and only if they’re whimsical.
- Medium-sized think tank/research institute. Routinely give press conferences but no one attends, and no one’s entirely sure what their research is about.

### Points of Interest

- Well in the courtyard; left very much alone – it has bad juju.
- The cemetary is the place to be; good walking paths, everyone hangs out there.
- An area of the neighbourhood is well lit but has no source of light – and sources of light brought into it cease working, permanently.

### Local Issues/Rumors

- Ordnance disposal was not completed; there are still lingering magical munitions.
- Drug-related violence due to lack of attention from authorities/Thah; periodic severe crackdowns


## Shadow

- **Name:** TBD
- **Occupation:** Literature graduate student.
- **Skill:** Research; focus on interpretation of texts
- **Memento:** Crime & Punishment novel

## Soul: The Dancer

The Dancer is grace and movement. It is the creation of beauty and art, and the appreciation of
the same.

**Symbol/Image:** The Dancer is depicted as a perfectly formed androgynous figure of grace and beauty.

**Gift:** The character becomes untouchable until the sun next sets. They cannot be harmed or affected by anything, nor can they affect anything. They can, however, move at incredible speeds, moving 100 miles (160km) in the blink of an eye, or almost anywhere in the world before the effect ends.

## Arc: Finish a Great Work
Something that was begun in the past must now be completed.

- (*Active*) **Opening:** Assessing the Past. 1 Acumen reward. You look at what has come before and where it still needs to go. This almost certainly involves some real research.
- **Step:** Conceive a Plan. 1 Acumen reward. You make a plan on how to move forward.
- **Step(s):** Progress. 1 Acumen reward. You make significant progress or overcome a barrier to completion. This may involve multiple such steps.
- **Climax:** Completion. 2 Acumen reward. This involves the big finish to the past work. A successful finale results in 1 Joy. Failure results in 1 Despair.
- **Resolution:** 1 Acumen reward. You reflect on what you did and where you go from here.

## Spells

#### Lies of the Mirror
*Grey*

- **Level 1**
- **Depletion:** Ends automatically when the sun next rises or sets.

My appearance changes slightly, making me seem slightly better or worse looking, slightly taller or shorter, slightly heavier or thinner, and so on. The changes are notable, but I don’t change so much that I no longer look like myself.

If I am a Stoic, this spell costs me no Sorcery to cast if I do so before a mirror.

#### Viuan’s Teleosis
*Gold*

- **Level 1**
- **Depletion:** 0 (check each use)

When I cast this on an object I touch, the object becomes a perfect form of itself. When used properly, the object adds +1 to the action it is being used for.

## Secrets

*None*

## Ephemera

Ephemera limit: 3

#### King of What’s Left
*Blue*

- **Level 2 Ephemera Object (Triangular card)**

You burn the card, which releases a memory that you had forgotten (or details about a memory that you vaguely remember). You can guide the card to which memory you’d like it to show you, but it may not listen.

The memory plays out in the form of shadows on the nearest wall. You can speed up or slow down the memory as you desire, but it appears only once.

#### The Dead Hunger for Justice
*Pale*

- **Level 2 Incantation (+1 die)**
- **Depletion:** 0 (check each round)

You cast this incantation on a nearby creature. If the target has ever killed anyone, a ghostly image of the victim appears next to the target, looking angry and remaining for the duration of the incantation. The image cannot affect or be affected by anything physically. If the target has multiple victims, one appears at random.

#### The Dead See Your Dismay and Look Askance
*Pale*

- **Level 2 Incantation (+1 die)**
- **Depletion:** 0 (check each round)

You touch one person (other than yourself) and temporarily connect them to the aethyr, for all intents and purposes turning them into a mobile aethyric lamp. In addition to providing light, they reveal any ghosts within a few feet of them.
