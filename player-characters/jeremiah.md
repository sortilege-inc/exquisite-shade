## Forte: Splinters Into Fragments

#### Defensive Splintering
*Invisible*

- **Level 2**

When I am attacked, I splinter into many pieces and then reform instantly. While I am splintered, some attacks pass right through me. I gain +1 to all Dodge defense actions. This is not an action in and of itself.

## Connections
___
- **Stewards of the Stamwhence Parade:** Level 1
- *TBD:* Level 2

## Bonds

### PC Bonds

#### Fated Companions: Marweg

While not friends, two characters always seem to be crossing paths. They frequently turn up at the same places at the same time. Perhaps there is a reason for all this that will become clear later.

- **Benefit:** At some point in the narrative, fate intervenes. Each character has all their pools refreshed and all Injuries, Wounds, and Anguishes healed, and both succeed on their next action, regardless of what it is (assuming it is not utterly impossible). Both characters must agree as to when this happens and have it fit their background story.
- **Drawback:** Once the characters use the benefit, the bond is basically done.

## Foundation: Connected

- **Income:** 50 crystal orbs
- **Initial savings:** 80 crystal orbs

### House
*Level 2*

Minton, on the Stamwhence Parade in Fartown.

Large house, with room to host dance parties.

### Neighbors

- His Large house is part of the Parade of Homes
- There is a homeowner’s guild. Fines for noncompliance, mandatory theme weeks.
- The Most fashionable house leads the parade
- There is a house entirely made of running water, sans plumbing (which is rock). Floor just keeps going down.

### Points of Interest

- The pedal pub found itself part of the parade
- One of the houses has been on fire for 17 years.
- There is a city square that the parade navigates clockwise regularly. There is a statue in the middle. The square is only accessible to the parade.

### Local Issues/Rumors

- One of the parading homes has paperwork that seems legitimate, but the Association insists that they were not properly approved. Ongoing bet as to where the paperwork came from; Jeremiah may have been involved.
- Rumour has it that the parade is fleeing something; and the fact that the parade hasn’t stopped is evidence that whatever is chasing it, is still out there.

## Shadow

- **Name:** TBD
- **Occupation:** Realtor
- **Skill:** Persuasion
- **Memento:** White elephant gift toy soldier

## Soul: The Dancer

The Dancer is grace and movement. It is the creation of beauty and art, and the appreciation of
the same.

**Symbol/Image:** The Dancer is depicted as a perfectly formed androgynous figure of grace and beauty.

**Gift:** The character becomes untouchable until the sun next sets. They cannot be harmed or affected by anything, nor can they affect anything. They can, however, move at incredible speeds, moving 100 miles (160km) in the blink of an eye, or almost anywhere in the world before the effect ends.

## Arc: Develop a Bond

You want to get closer to another character (NPC or PC).

- (*Active*) **Opening:** Getting to know you. 1 Acumen reward. You learn what you can about the other character.
- **Step:** Initial Attempt. 1 Acumen reward. You attempt to make contact.
- **Step(s):** Building a relationship. 2Acumen reward. There might be many such steps as you develop the relationship.
- **Climax:** Bond. 3 Acumen reward. You succeed or fail at forging the bond. A successful resolution results in 1 Joy. Failure results in 1 Despair. Success also results in a PC or NPC bond.
- **Resolution:** 1 Acumen reward. You enjoy the fruits of your new relationship

## Spells

#### Dream Intrusion
*Blue*

- **Level 2 (+1 die)**

I enter the dream of a close being who is asleep and already dreaming. I can take on whatever appearance I want, change the environment, and essentially control whatever happens. The dreamer, when they awaken, remembers the dream, but to them it is just a dream, foggy and strange, and it fades quickly. There are no other lasting effects, no matter what I did in the dream.

Casting this spell takes an action, as normal, but I must concentrate while the dream is going on, which usually requires ten to fifteen minutes.

## Secrets

*None*

\columnbreak


## Ephemera

Ephemera limit: 3

#### A Moment of Clarity Before the Curtain Rises
*Blue*

- **Level 2 Incantation**

When you speak to someone, you think of exactly the right thing to say. You add 3 bene to your Interaction pool.

#### Adiabatic Flame
*Gold*

- **Level 1 Ephemera Object (Red and black madstone)**

The stone burns with a powerful flame (like a burning bit of phosphor) until the sun next rises, but it gives off no heat and burns nothing it touches - unless you wish it to.

#### A Glimmer Hides in the Shadows
*Grey*

- **Level 2 Incantation**
- **Depletion:** 0 (check each hour)

You make one magical object, manifestation, spell, or effect register as nonmagical to those with the ability to sense, see, or otherwise detect such things.
