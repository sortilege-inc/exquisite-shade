Favors right hand.

### Abilities

#### Speak with Spirits

We can speak, read, and write the language of any but the most obscure spiritual entities.

#### Create a Protective Circle

We inscribe a protective barrier that offers +2 defense against spiritual entities of the realm we choose when we create the circle. The circle is large enough to accommodate us or perhaps one other person instead. Alternatively, if summoning an entity, we can create a protective circle and summon the being inside the circle. In this case, the circle is always large enough to accommodate the conjured being. Creating a circle requires ten minutes of work.

#### Summoning

**Available types:** counsel, aid, guard, spy

We can summon beings of up to level 3. Once we successfully convince them to perform the desired task, they can move up to a mile away from us, and can take up to an hour to complete the task, if needed and appropriate. Summoning requires one round of time and the devotion of 1 Sorcery per level of the summoned being.

## Forte: Converses with Everything

The secrets involved in my abilities are well kept. I need to determine where I got them.

### Psychometry
*Indigo*

- **Level 1 (+1 die)**

When I touch a creature or object, I get a sense of something about its nature or past.

## Connections
___
- **Order of Goetica:** Level 1
- **Lattice Vitale:** Level 1
- *The Association of Erotic Progenation:* Level 1

## Bonds

### PC Bonds

#### Fated Companions: Jeremiah

While not friends, two characters always seem to be crossing paths. They frequently turn up at the same places at the same time. Perhaps there is a reason for all this that will become clear later.

- **Benefit:** At some point in the narrative, fate intervenes. Each character has all their pools refreshed and all Injuries, Wounds, and Anguishes healed, and both succeed on their next action, regardless of what it is (assuming it is not utterly impossible). Both characters must agree as to when this happens and have it fit their background story.
- **Drawback:** Once the characters use the benefit, the bond is basically done.

#### Shadow Friends: Winstead

Two characters knew each other in Shadow. It’s possible that they escaped Shadow at the same time, or in the same circumstances.

- **Benefit:** If the characters have the same Shadow skill, it is level 3 instead of level 2.
- **Drawback:** If one PC is pulled back into Shadow, the other suffers a −1 on all actions until the friend returns.

## Arc: New Discovery
You want to discover something new.

- (*Active*) **Opening:** The Idea. 1 Acumen reward. Find and acquire a "pet" that is not only largely unknown in Satyrine (specifically by members of the exotic pet society) but which has some unique aspect to it that would make it remarkable within the exotic pet circle.
- **Step:** Research. 1 Acumen reward. You learn what people have done before and recognize where they fell short.
- **Step(s):** Trial and Error. 1 Acumen reward. You test your hypothesis. This often ends in many failures before you get a success.
- **Climax:** Eureka!. 3 Acumen reward. It's time to put the discovery to the true test.. A successful resolution results in 1 Joy. Failure results in 1 Despair.
- **Resolution:** 1 Acumen reward. You reflect on your discovery and probably compile your notes and write it all down, for posterity if nothing else.

### Spells

#### Exiguous Appeasement
*Silver*

- **Level 1**

I conjure a trifle that will please a specific nearby being I choose. The object is impractical and inexpensive, but delightful to the target. Examples include a piece of their favorite candy, a paper origami of their favorite animal, or a glass bead that is their favorite color. I don't control what I create, but I know it will please them if I give it as a gift. In certain circumstance, it might grant me a one-time bonus to an interaction.

### Secrets

*None*

\columnbreak


### Ephemera

Ephemera limit: 3

#### Memory of Touch
*Green*

- **Level 1 Incantation**

A small handheld object that you have used (such as a pen you have written with, a knife you have thrown, or a teapot you have poured) will perform the same action again on its own once, as you direct, as long as it doesn't take more than a few rounds.

#### Devouring Valise
*Grey*

- **Level 2 Ephemera Object (Bezoar)**

After the bezoar is placed in a small bag or case, it disappears. Afterward, you can place one object in the bag that cannot be found until you wish it, whether the bag is full of other things or completely empty. Further, the bag resists any indication that it is magical for those who can discern such things as if it were level 8.

#### Asomatous Hand
*Pale*

- **Level 2 Ephemera Object (String to tie around a finger)**
- **Depletion:** 0-3 (check each hour)

Your hand becomes ghostly and can pass through matter selectively, albeit quite slowly. So you can pass it through a door and flip the latch on the other side. You can reach through someone's chest and grab their heart (although they'd have to stand very still for a considerable time).

## Menagerie

#### Jubee (Jubilee)

Jubee is a living tune from the Blue lands. It lives in a set of bells that it likes to resonate through. Marweg always need to be careful to clear his mind of anything similar Jubee's tune after visiting it, lest Jubee follow Marweg out of the house and escape.

#### Vella

From the Red lands, this is one of only a very few demons in Marweg's collection. (Aside from finding demons to be rather "common" and "utilitarian", demons' destructive natures do not lend them to making good pets.) Vella is only about 6 inches long and moves slowly, so is less of a challenge. She lives in a terrarium surrounded by a circle of warding. Every couple of weeks Marweg purchases some cheap artwork or craft from local artisans and gives it to Vella, who derives sustenance from vandalizing it.

#### Moro, Duo, and Avo

These are creelings from the Pale lands. These are very simple, weak spirits who seek to regain their physical nature by constructing bodies from anything they can find, preferably organic material but ultimately anything will work. They are only the size of house cats and are far too weak to take over anything living. Creelings show a wide range of personalities - Moro, Duo, and Avo all clearly have strong affection and are very supportive of each other, which was what attracted Marweg to them and caused him to bring them home. (Otherwise, their bodies would likely be stolen by other, more aggressive creelings in the Pale lands.) There is something disturbingly sweet about seeing a creature pull off its own arm and hand it to another whose leg just came off and fell behind the sofa. He usually keeps them in the back of the house when guests arrive, since some are put off by having something made out of discarded cans, beetle carapaces, some fabric, and the desiccated remains of a dead rat jump into your lap and demand scritches. The rest of the time, though, they are given free access to the house.

#### Ramunel

One of Marweg's sources of income is his cherub breeding program. High quality, pure-bread cherubs are a luxury item and status symbol for the wealthy of Satyrine. Marweg has a kennel of a dozen or so cherubim that he trains and breeds. He's won best-of-show at local events a couple of times, and he makes a small income on stud fees and selling those that he doesn't want to keep in his breeding program. Ramunel would have been one of the latter, but there was something about its personality that grew on Marweg (despite his general lack of interest in angels), so Marweg had Ramunel neutered and kept him at the house.

#### Lucy

Adog from Shadow. This is not actually Marweg's Shadow memento - it was the Shadow memento of another vislae who crossed to the Pale a couple of years ago, so Lucy came to live with Marweg. Lucy isn't real, of course, but she is still a very good dog.

## Summonings

### Named Entities

#### Spindlerieve
*Level 1 Creature*

Marweg came across information about this creature, a dweller of the Blue sun, in a manuscript that was gathering dust in the home of a wealthy cherub owner that Marweg was visiting to discuss stud fees. Marweg agreed to take the text in lieu of payment. The text describes how to contact Spindlerieve, a sentient mass of millions of multi-colored threads that appear spinning and weaving through the air. The author was unclear whether Spindlerieve was, in fact, a single creature, or a race of creatures that shared a single memory. Whatever the fact might be, Spindlerieve can be summoned at multiple levels, as low as 2. (The author did not establish a maximum level.) The higher the level, the larger and more densely packed the threads. At level 2, Spindlerieve is slightly smaller than a person with a density that is almost but not quite opaque. Spindlerieve is physically weak, but is capable of getting into just about anything that isn't airtight and, by spreading itself out, can observe a large area. Spindlerieve is difficult to harm by most means - only by fully severing threads from the rest of its mass do those pieces "die". (In its normal form, the fact that thread are connected at multiple points means that only fire or other massive damage would be effective. If spread out, however, the contacts are fewer, leaving Spindlerieve more vulnerable.) Even total destruction of a summoned portion is not enough to kill the whole being, and it can be summoned again later although it will remember the summoner who led to its partial death and be loath to treat with them again. Spindlerieve is naturally curious about "connectedness" especially in non-physical senses (e.g., emotional, cause-effect, etc.) and it helps if the reason for its summoning can be cast in those terms. Spindlerieve is also fond of unique or especially impressive-looking fibers - it isn't clear if it absorbs them or just collects them, but they appear to be the only thing Spindlerieve is able to bring back with it from a summoning.

### Contract Summonings

#### The Braghosi
*Demon - Contract, Order of Goetica*

This is a race of demon that is commonly used a bodyguards. The eat damage. Literally. The creature sustains itself by consuming the injuries inflicted upon other living creatures. (Doing this does not hear or repair this injury. The injury is just "consumed".) The Braghosi can be summoned at a variety of levels. They are not especially smart or fast, but they are quite tough. They generally try to avoid injuring others - that would be to give away injury. However, when acting as a guard they will block and harry attackers. They use small arm shields to avoid receiving harm (it still hurts them and they can be killed through violence), but they will consume their own injuries if inflicted. The Braghosi want to be paid in pain for their services. The contract stipulates a flat rate that (in game mechanic terms) comes to one health per level of summoned creature, plus each health level lost by the creature in service to the summoner times 1.2 rounded up. (The contract uses appropriate metaphysical terms.) Invoking the contract also give the summoner up to two days to make good on their bill, after which it starts to accrue interest at a steep rate until such time as the Braghosi feel the summoner isn't going to pay, at which point they are empowered to come and collect more directly. Marweg has used the Braghosi a few times and generally finds paying them to be quite simple - enough of his menagerie enjoy live food that he just invokes the debt during feeding time and has been able to pay the summoning off. (That said, none of the Braghosi he has summon ever ended up sustaining significant injuries, so his debt has never been too high.)

### Misc Summonings

#### Ophanim

Multi-eyed, winged angels. They are traditionally used as spies, although Marweg sometimes summons them for counsel to ask about spirits and creatures they have seen. They prefer activities that allow them to be in motion and travel. (They dislike "stay and watch" work.) They can be propitiated with incense or, in a pinch, interesting perfume or cologne.

#### Kyrian Leeches

Despite their appearance, these creatures (crosses between a slug and a crab) are angels. While not too bright, they have beneficial effects on injuries and are often summoned to aid in healing. They can close wounds and help reduce the impact of some diseases and poisons. They abhor injury and so can often be coerced into helping by threatening to make an injury worse. They also can be bribed with feathers for some reason.

#### Spyricks

These are demons of decay. They are physically weak, but very perceptive and can spot the weak points of structures, materials, and people (including emotional and intellectual weak points). In general, they are willing to help if the weak spot will be immediately exploited to damage the target. (And don't stiff them - they know your weak spots too.) Alternately, they may accept payment in the form of an especially fragile item that they can break themselves.

#### Florosa Swarms

These are creatures of the Green. They are composite beings consisting of multiple little gas bags, about the size of a tennis ball, surrounded by about a dozen long, thin, fuzzy legs. The legs of about 20 bags interlock to form a single swarm and once joined they tend to stay together unless some are killed. Each individual bag contributes a particular aspect of a swarm's personality, so changes to the composition of a swarm will result in a different personality. Swarms float and are capable of carrying significant loads. They can also use their free legs to perform fine manipulation, so they tend to be summoned for a variety of manual labors. They don't tend to like being summoned and so are hard to persuade, but they are generally willing to be paid in metal.

\columnbreak

#### Mnemons

These are memory spirits from the Pale sun. They are collections of memories on various subjects that have enough gravity to continue existing after being shed by their host. Each Mnemon usually contains the combined memories from multiple people - the memories seem to congeal when released. A single Mnemon is going to have memories related to a handful of topics. When summoned, the summoner shares those memories. This is always a bit of a crap shoot since one never knows what skills one will remember. Moreover, memories of physical skills do not directly translate to being able to actually perform those skills - without the physical ability and muscle memory, the memories don't translate to the summoner's body. Finally, none of the memories are retained beyond the summoning - one might remember taking actions under the influence of a given skill but the "why" would be lost. Even notes taken under the presence of a Mnemon are likely to only be of marginal use after the summoning since the context of the notes would be lost. (Think of going back to your old school notes 20 years after taking the class and trying to understand them.) The memories do not come with any personality or will - a summoner with a Mnemon still has their own personality. Mnemons are relatively easy to summon - the memories want to be remembered by someone so the colloquy is generally just trying to get through to the semi-mindless Mnemon that this is exactly what you are trying to do. However, because the skills one (briefly) acquires are so random, they are seldom summoned.
