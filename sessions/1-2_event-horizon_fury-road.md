# Previously, on Exquisite Shade

Among the many creatures in Marweg’s menagerie is an ivehone, a creature of the Blue sun whose sustenance is moments. Ivehones are rather expensive and don’t play well with other creatures, but they are quite popular among a certain crowd and Marweg considers himself fortunate to have one even if he needs to make special arrangements for it to live in his menagerie. One of the interesting properties of an ivehone is that they share the moments of those with whom they have contact and these moments sustain them. If one later looks at the ivehone, one will see short snatches of past events that one has experienced. When Marweg (and Winstead) later view Marweg’s ivehone, this is what they see:

Ward (hosting the spirit Du Va Leigh) arrives with Rhea at Minton house in the Stamwhence Parade, with Marweg arriving shortly after. Jeremiah welcomes them.

Winstead, sitting in a somewhat run-down room that is nonetheless recognizable as a doctor’s office. Winstead rubs their head as if it hurts. An exceptionally pale man who appears to be the doctor looks down at a set of images with ill-concealed concern.

The interior of Minton house. Ward/Du Va Leigh is dancing with Penelope while a hulking, silent figure stands in the background. Marweg and Fickhart (from Sunpath Safaris) converse with Millems, their eyes glazing over. Rhea dances with Querius, who is entirely jet black and an excellent dancer. A wide variety of guests appear in the background.

Winstead in the Orientation Center for new arrivals from Shadow. A clerk stares off into space for a moment then writes an address on a piece of paper and hands it to Winstead.

Winstead sleeping at home, waking suddenly and holding their head. The sheets of the bed are a mess, suggesting that this is not the first time this has happened that night.

The party. Marty greets Ward, interrupting his dance with Penelope. Shortly thereafter Rhea arrives and leads him away, listening sympathetically as Marty elaborately describes some travail, but by this point Penelope has moved on and is dancing with someone else. Marweg is conversing with Früz & Smick, who appear dressed as stage magicians although Smick now appears to be wearing Marweg’s shirt and Marweg is wearing some odd Hawaiian shirt. Po, a giant man in an old military uniform joins them. Früz and Marweg exchange addresses and appear to be involved in a detailed discussion (which for Marweg generally means a topic relating to his menagerie).

Jeremiah introducing Celeste (a high-level weaver) to Rhea. Celeste and Rhea discuss. Celeste appears to be offering assistance to Rhea, for which she is evidently grateful.

Winstead, still in the rumpled clothes in which they slept, peddling madly on a bike in visible panic, occasionally looking at the small scrap of paper the clerk and the orientation center handed them. The back of their head and neck seems to be splitting open.

Winstead, collapsing in front of their own home, a look of pain, confusion, and frustration on their face.

At the party, Ward/Du Va Leigh are dancing, visibly angling to resume dancing with Penelope who is currently dancing with someone else. Penelope doesn’t seem to notice them, but Penelope’s current partner clearly does and doesn’t seem happy for the interruption. Rhea chatting with Violet, a man with a disconcerting, constant smile, who has a reputation as an information broker.

Winstead, waking up in their own bed, confused to be looking and feeling fine. A hand tentatively reaches towards the back of their head, which now appears whole and unmarked.

Winstead standing on their front step looking at their own lifeless body, a gaping rift splitting their back from skull to hip. Spatters of blood and gore around the corpse seem to suggest that something emerged from this gory fissure. Winstead’s eyes show madness and despair.

At the party, Ward has managed to resume dancing with Penelope. Marweg is in the ballroom conversing with Fickhart, who seems concerned about something. Elsewhere in the room the parade wardens seem deep in serious conversation.

Winstead, running in panic towards the cursed well. Suddenly, the well is gone and instead Winstead is looking at the lead house of the Stamwhence Parade. Winstead climbs over the perfect picket fence and collapses in to the manicured front lawn of the lead house.

At the party, the knot of parade stewards seems to have moved from concern to panic and outrage, much of the latter seemingly directed towards Annalise, the route planner, who appears very upset. Rhea is nearby and a few people are standing around her listening to her with expressions that suggest they are looking to her for guidance. Marweg stands nearby, listening. Elsewhere, some guests appear to be panicking, some sprinting for the door of the house while others seem to be moving deeper into the interior, away from the windows. Outside, a mist is swallowing the waterfall house, which is the house before Minton House in the parade. Ward and Penelope continue to dance, oblivious to everything.

Those still in Minton house, staring in shock and horror out the windows at the ruined landscape of Gatesmithe, through which the Parade is currently traveling.

# Event Horizon

Everyone is disoriented when the Stamwhence Parade, previously gracing the streets of Arca in Fartown, passed through a heat haze and appeared in what appears to be the wastelands of the Ruined Expanse somewhere in Satyrine.

## Panic at the disco

**Jeremiah** will do what he can to protect his guests. who are panicking. He can be aided by the other players to restore order. There are about 40 guests affected.

* Persuasion (challenge 6): Settles an individual. They will then attempt to calm another person.
* Oratory (challenge 8): Settles a group of 8-12.

Some people are attempting to leave Minton House or the Stamwhence Parade entirely. The same tests can be attempted to prevent this.

**Du Va Leigh** panics, and **Ward** must succeed on an opposed Composure test (Interaction) before attempting another action. Ward gets +2 to his rolls.

## Into the Wastelands

Annalise needs help figuring out where the parade is, and how to bring it out of the ruined expanse. Players can test Orienteering (Perception), challenge 11. If they fail by two or less, they determine they are still somewhere in Fartown; four or less, they know that they are still in Satyrine.

Regardless of the success or failure of getting oriented, players can test Navigation (Intellect), challenge 9, to help Annalise choose a direction for the Parade to continue on. Regardless of the direction chosen, it will pass through the Hate Cyst that lives in the abandoned building that has been Winstead's temporary abode.

___
> ##### Annalise's Fortune
> **Looming Shade/Whispering Lover/Incriminating Skull**
> 
> A bad omen/unseen threat, wants to help Jeremiah. Hidden information becomes exposed, blocking the relationship.

\columnbreak



## Boons of Protection

If player characters explicitly protect or aid any of the following high-status individuals, they will be granted a boon after the session by that individual.

* Gertrude: Master of the Pacts (5th Degree Goetic) Cruelly sarcastic and entitled, but from a truly established position. Her gray hair is tied up, and bees dart two and fro from the exposed honeycomb of her skull.
* Timony & Antimony:  Master Shaper (5th Degree Maker) Vaguely feminine and masculine bodies of shimmering metal. (cf. Silver Surfer). Ambiguous whether it is one person or two. They weave and dance as one, moving in and through one another. Members of the Chalmara Sodality, high up.
* Celeste: Mistress of the Warp & Weft (5th Degree Weaver). Six arms, runes on palms. Face is a mask that hovers in front of a blank skull. Associated with the Cahdedron.
* Lucerin: Wears a white circular button on a leather jacket with animated patches, with a mini-skirt, torn leggings, and heels. Grooves on the dance floor, circumspect, has traversed the nightside path of suns. (Apostate). Secretly Hendassa.
* Po: Decorated Magus (5th Degree Vance). Comes off like a late 19th century European general. Refers to himself in the third person.

# Fury Road

Having oriented themselves and aided Annalise with navigation, the Stamwhence Parade stumbles upon the cause of Winstead's panic: the Hate Cyst of Gatesmithe. The route of the parade is inadvertently heading directly into danger.

## Nyr's Fruit

The seeds from Winstead's body have sprouted, bringing forth two cyst spawn and awakening a siege worm that begin to attack the Stamwhence Parade.

Even being within the general vicinity of the Hate Cyst is dangerous. A mental whining grows louder as the vislae approach. They must succeed at Resist defense actions (challenge 8) or suffer 1 point of mental damage every ten minutes until they leave the area. Should someone sustain an Anguish from this, they immediately begin to hallucinate, seeing their nearest ally transform into a horrific monstrosity. The victim must flee screaming or strike out with intent to destroy, depending on their nature. The hallucination lasts until the Anguish is alleviated.

___
> ## Cyst Spawn: Hellminth
> Humanoid that has been ripped in half in the midsection, with the upper torso floating above the lower. In the gap, wormy things emerge with disgusting, toothy mouths. Makes no sound at all, seemingly fading in and out of existence in a regular rhythm. It bites with the many mouths on the emergent worms, and it can make attacks against insubstantial targets as well as material ones. Worse, it passes right through a victim's defenses.

skirts, under which live dozens of feral cats. Hands

dying. (*The Path*, pg. 128)

> Siege worms were sentient, demonic weapons of war, laying waste to huge areas or smashing the sturdiest of defenses. A few remain in the Ruined Expanses, now asleep. But if awoken—usually by using potent magic (or particularly magical flux) near them—they are terrifying engines of destruction and death. They take different forms, but most are gigantic, multilimbed worm-like things of some configuration. (*Secrets of Silent Streets*, pg. 212)

## What is going on?

The characters do not initially understand what is going on, but those around them are not so ignorant. Speaking with **Celeste**, **Angela**, **Gertrude**, **Lucerin**, **Po**, or **Früz**, the characters will learn that they have likely stumbled onto a **Hate Cyst**.

Angela immediately will telepathically communicate all Stamwhence Parade homeowners (including Jeremiah) to "awaken their homes", and to enlist assistance as necessary.

For the remainder of the scenario, every 10 minutes all characters at a given house must successfully Resist (8) and the current house must make a successful Dodge or Withstand (10). The Parade moves at the rate of 1 house per 10 minutes, so after 110 minutes, all houses are past; the monsters will not give chase.

### The Angel of Stamwhence

Angela Jones leaves Minton house for α β γ, discovering Winstead on her lawn. She gives Winstead a briefing and casts *Prescient Defense* on her before transforming into a horrifying, beautiful angel.

#### Prescient Defense
*Indigo*
___
- **Level 4**
- **Depletion:** 0-3 (check each hour)
___
I see incoming attacks on me before they strike. I automatically succeed on any two defensive actions of my choice while the spell is active. Spell depletes over time normally or if I use it against two attacks, whichever comes first.

# Mustering

Gertrude offers to relieve Jeremiah of responsibilities regarding guest safety, assuring him that she has the ballroom in order and that he ought to see about the wellbeing of his house and the parade more generally.

The players have three options available to them; these are non-exclusive, but there will not be time to do all of them. They will be strongly encouraged to awaken the Parade first.

* Assist Celeste, Früz & Smick in creating magical barriers.
* Join Lucerin and Po in mounting an offensive against the siege worm and cyst spawn.
* Assist Mr. Whiskers, Annalise, Carrie and Cole in 'awakening the Parade'.

## Bolster

If the players assist Celeste, Früz & Smick, they are each granted an incantation from the following list. Celeste, Früz & Smick may each cast one not claimed by a player.

They then move within range of either Po and Lucerin, or Angela, and any other contributing characters, and act as supports. Players may switch to another task at any point during this period. If supporting Angela, this is done from the heights of The Tower.

### Incantations

#### Walking Among Ghosts
*Pale*
___
- **Level 6**
- **Depletion:** 0 (check each round)
___
You become insubstantial, like a spirit. You cannot affect the world around you, nor can you be affected. You can move through solid objects.

#### Unraveled Cloth Across The Sky
*Blue*
___
- **Level 6**
- **Depletion:** 0 (check each round)
___
Allies who can see you are given courage and fortitude, and they add +1 to all defenses until they cannot see you or the effect depletes.

#### Cry Independence and Set Flames
*Invisible*
___
- **Level 6 (+1 die)**
- **Depletion:** Ends automatically when the sun next sets
___
Not only do you add +2 to all Resist defense actions, but anyone who attempts to affect your mind with any sort of magical effect suffers 2 points of damage from the feedback if you resist.

\columnbreak

#### The Other Reflection Is the Real You
*Grey*
___
- **Level 5**
___
After casting this, the next two times you are physically attacked, the attacks are foiled because you're not where the attacker thought, but a step or two to the side. The attacker sees a mirror-like duplicate shatter into glass when they make the foiled attack.

#### Lyrics of Peace Admonish the Soldier
*Red*
___
- **Level 5 (+1 die)**
- **Depletion:** 0 (check each round)
___
You open your mouth and release a war cry so fierce and horrible that it causes all nearby creatures (including you) to turn on each other for two rounds. Affected creatures are in a frenzy, inflicting an additional 2 points of damage with each successful attack. When the effect ends, you are healed of 1 Anguish or Wound.

#### The Gaze Turns Inward to See Real Beauty
*Blue*
___
- **Level 5 (+1 die)**
___
You cast this on a nearby being and control all their senses as they pertain to anything near them. Essentially, you are creating a full sensory illusion in a medium area around them, but only they see it—it is purely mental. This continues as long as you spend your action each round controlling it.

#### An Ocean Only I Can See
*Blue*
___
- **Level 5**
- **Depletion:** 0 (check each round)
___
Every time someone casts a spell within short range, you gain 1 bene to your Sorcery pool.

#### Surely now Is Better Than Before
*Green*
___

___
You heal 1 Wound or Anguish on a creature within long range.

## The Best Defense

If the players decide to join in the fight, they have the option to either join Angela (above), Lucerin, or Po. The latter two will move to the house next to be affected by the cyst spawn.

## Awakenings

There are four houses eligible to be awakened.

### Mr. Whiskers/Kingston

Mr. Whiskers will escort the players to Kingston on the way to Le Roix. He will explain that Kingston is a golem, and that it's as simple as finding the animating word, and placing under the golem's tongue. Mr. Whiskers does not, however, know where either the script or the tongue are, except that both are within the house.

1. Find script
2. Find tongue
3. One player can choose to control Kingston

### Annalise/Vici

Annalise will escort the players to Vici, the house of water. She will help them, but does not know what awakening her house means. She says she skimmed something in the contract when she bought the house a few months ago but didn't really understand what it was about.

The players can Persuade Annalise (Interaction, challenge 5) to dig up the contract to review the terms. An Insight (Intellect, challenge 8) test will reveal a clause:

___
> ##### § 47.80.13b Responsibilities for collective defense
> Homeowner acknowledges that their home entity may be automatically or manually awoken in service to the Stamwhence Parade's defense. Damages incurred in such an event are not subject to indemnification. Homeowner agrees to obtain third party insurance at their own expense.

Scribbled below, is a note that the players can try to make out (Interpretation, Intellect, challenge 7). If successful, they read "Reach into the current and speak the language of water."

Alternately, players can stick their head into the running water of one of the walls. A Sense test (Sorcery, challenge 11) will reveal that Vici *is* the house. Vici can be awoken by a Summon test (Interaction, challenge 14); this difficulty is halved (challenge 7) if the name Vici is used explicitly.

On successful awakening, one player may take control of Vici, the water elemental. It will place the other characters in its place on the parade grounds.

### Carrie/Rus

Carrie brings the players to her and Cole's apartment at Rus, an old wooden house that looks comfortably lived in and only a little ominous.

She brings them into her living room and then explains that she's not a vislae, but she can walk them through the ritual. Carrie draws some mysterious symbols on the floor, east, and southern walls. She removes all her clothes, and requests for one other to join her, sans clothing.

Drawing a sharp blade, she cuts a thin line across her collar bone, dipping down below to avoid the neck. As the blood starts to well, she passes the blade over to the player and indicates to do likewise. Her eyes roll back as she enters a trance state, chanting in an unknown language. Players can recognize the name 'Rus' if Carrie has mentioned it before.

This awakens the demon, Rus. The participating player will control Rus for the remainder of the scenario.

### Cole/Sumac

Cole takes the players past his house in Rus, and over to the next 'house', if a house it can be called. Sumac is a giant, lumbering, animated skeleton of what must have been a mastodon. It is not currently occupied, but Cole asserts that it is animated by magic and if only the animating command can be changed, Sumac can be used to defend the parade.

A successful Animate Dead (Sorcery, challenge 10) will direct Sumac towards the cyst spawn. That player takes control of Sumac for the remainder of the scenario.

# The House that Hate built

The Hate Cyst lies deep in the basement of the abandoned building Winstead had made her home. It will be in the same room where **Nyr** had toasted Winstead.

Once they reach the cyst, it looks like a throbbing sac of diseased tissue, about twice the size of a person. This close to the cyst, the flesh of intruders begins to flake off, liquefy, or bubble up with terrible sores. Those failing a Withstand action (challenge 10) in a given round suffer 1 Wound.
Dealing 20 points of damage from magical attacks to the cyst will destroy it. But each time a vislae successfully inflicts damage on the cyst, they see a vision of a loved one suffering that damage instead, inflicting an equal amount of damage upon the vislae if they fail a Resist action (challenge 10).

## Wrapping up

Destroying a Hate Cyst is worth 3 Acumen and possibly 1 Joy. The **Deathless Triumvirate** will give a reward of 100 gem orbs for proof of the destruction of a Hate Cyst.
